  <h2>Web Design and Me: <em>Frustration Leads to Fascination</em></h2>
    <p>
      While most of my time at The Fig Leaf is spent cutting fabric and assisting customers, I was afforded the opportunity to build a website for the furniture side of the business, <a href="http://www.thefigleaffurniture.com">www.thefigleaffurniture.com</a>, using <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a>. On the quilting side of the business, I've worked extensively with e-commerce bulk product management via spreadsheet. I also redesigned our logo recently, which you
      can view on the <a href="http://www.thefigleafquilting.com/">quilting website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in learning html began with frustrations with the limitations of the built-in content management system offered by the host of my store's website. My goal was to build an aesthetically pleasing, responsive layout featuring the various sewing machine models available at The Fig Leafâ€”my aunt's quilt shop where I have been employed for the last 5 years. I could make the layout responsive, but the content management system offered no way of aligning or positioning the items to acheive visual balance. I knew there had to be a better way and that it started with learning how to code html and css myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been casually entertaining the idea of pursuing a career in web technologies for a couple of years. As I went through a few online html tutorials, I quickly realized this is my calling. For the first time in a long time, I felt the excitement of pursing a passion. I finally found what I had been looking for my whole life: a career that utilizes both my creativity and my analytical mind.
